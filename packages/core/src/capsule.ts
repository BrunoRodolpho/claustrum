/**
 * Capsule — the per-turn cognitive context handle.
 *
 * CRITICAL NAMING NOTE — Capsule is NOT `RuntimeContext`. The kernel
 * (@adjudicate/core) exports `RuntimeContext` which is the per-tenant
 * mutable-singleton container (kill switch, metrics sinks, etc.).
 * Capsule is the per-TURN context — short-lived, scoped to one
 * conversational turn, contains every port the cognitive loop needs.
 *
 * Conflating the two is a category error. Reviewers MUST surface
 * `ctx.adjudicate(...)` calls and confirm `ctx` is a Capsule (runtime)
 * vs `RuntimeContext` (kernel).
 *
 * The Capsule is constructed by `Conductor.openCapsule` and discarded
 * by `Conductor.closeCapsule` after the turn.
