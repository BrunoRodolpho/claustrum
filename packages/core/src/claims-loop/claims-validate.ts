/**
 * CLAIMS-VALIDATE — the deterministic post-planner wall (SDD §M / §Q.6; v1.1 §4,
 * §8; SDD §F).
 *
 * Runs the published Claims Kernel (`runClaimsKernel`, Q5 = P1 soundness ∘ P2
 * consistency) over the THREADED Evidence Ledger + the planner's candidate claims
 * → the renderable VALIDATED+consistent claim set + the turn terminal
 * (`RENDER | UNKNOWN | ESCALATE | CLARIFY`). This is the deterministic wall that
 * bounds the probabilistic planner (v1.1 §8): a mis-framed candidate degrades to
 * `UNKNOWN`/`ESCALATE`/`CLARIFY` rather than reaching the customer as a confident
 * wrong assertion.
 *
 * Topology (SDD §F — asymmetric, one-directional): the Ledger is read-only INPUT
 * here. The kernel CONSUMES it; this stage never writes back into it and nothing
 * flows Claims → Ledger → Read. claustrum imports `runClaimsKernel` (and the
 * verdict/terminal types) FROM the published `@adjudicate/core` — never the
 * reverse (the dependency arrow is `adjudicate → claustrum → ibatexas`).
 *
 * The deps (Q3 `SoundnessDeps` + the optional Q4 consistency table) are
 * repo-specific (ownership model, action-outcome wiring) and INJECTED on the
 * Capsule; this stage adds NO policy of its own. Between the planner and the
 * kernel it runs a PER-TURN RECONCILIATION over the threaded read-only ledger
 * that only adjusts kernel INPUTS (never a verdict, never a skipped conjunct):
 * (1) it FLOORS `now` up to the newest same-turn LIVE read so a first-party read
 * taken this turn is not future-stale; (2) when wired, it rebuilds the per-turn
 * `owns` / `outcomeConfirmed` from this turn's owner-scoped ledger reads + the
 * authenticated `customerId` (`claimsKernelDepsForTurn`); and (4b) it binds a
 * still-undefined bound candidate's `value` to its PRESENT first-party ledger
 * entry so C6 compares ledger-sourced scalars. The pure kernel then runs the full
 * §5 predicate over the reconciled inputs.

  // ownership/C4/C6 + the falsifier CAP + the CE#3 runtime arm) over the result.

  // (1) FRESHNESS FLOOR — clock-ordering fix (loop-side; the kernel guard is
  //     CORRECT and stays). The Conductor captures the per-turn `now` at
  //     openCapsule (turn START), BEFORE the investigator stamps each live read's
  //     `fetchedAt = Date.now()`. A SAME-TURN first-party read can thus carry
  //     `fetchedAt > now` by a few ms → the kernel's correct negative-age guard
  //     (`age >= 0`) rejects it → a valid live read demotes to UNKNOWN. FLOOR
  //     `now` up to the newest LIVE read's `fetchedAt` so a read taken THIS turn
  //     is never future-stale. The floor only RAISES `now`, and ONLY over
  //     `sourceMode === "live"` entries, so it can never mask a genuinely stale
  //     CACHED entry (an old cache `fetchedAt` < clock-now leaves `now`
  //     unchanged → its age stays large → still stale). `must_read_this_turn`
  //     freshness is clock-independent and unaffected.
