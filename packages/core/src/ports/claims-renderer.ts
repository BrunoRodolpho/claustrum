/**
 * ClaimsRendererPort — renders the customer-facing reply FROM the validated
 * claims (SDD §B / §J.6 / §O#3 / §Q.7; v1.1 §3). This is the seam that closes the
 * "claims-not-prose" thesis at the loop level: when the claim pipeline produced a
 * result, the reply TEXT is rendered DETERMINISTICALLY from the kernel's
 * renderable VALIDATED+consistent set + turn terminal — NOT authored by the
 * probabilistic responder model.
 *
 * Optional + adopter-supplied (ibatexas wires its `renderer-from-claims`): when
 * absent, `handleTurn` keeps the legacy model-responder reply (byte-identical).
 * When wired AND the CLAIMS-VALIDATE stage produced a `ClaimsKernelResult`, the
 * loop SUPERSEDES the draft's TEXT with this renderer's output (artifacts / usage
 * still come from the draft). The rendered text still passes the OUTPUT FIREWALL
 * (defense in depth) before egress.
 *
 * RENDER IS SOLE AUTHOR ON THE RENDERED PATH (Plan 1 Phase 3 / F6): once wired and
 * a claims result exists, the model responder draft NEVER reaches the customer —
 * the supersession is UNCONDITIONAL. A degenerate/EMPTY render does NOT fall back
 * to the operational responder draft; the loop emits a proposition-free SAFE
 * TERMINAL instead (never model-authored prose, never silence). The renderer is
 * expected to emit its own non-empty proposition-free safe template for any
 * non-RENDER terminal; the safe-terminal fallback is only the loop-level backstop.
 *
 * The renderer is a PURE deterministic template-filler in the adopter (no model,
 * no IO); this port carries only the seam contract. It consumes the published
 * `@adjudicate/core` `ClaimsKernelResult` — the SAME shape CLAIMS-VALIDATE emits
 * (the dependency arrow stays `adjudicate → claustrum → ibatexas`).
